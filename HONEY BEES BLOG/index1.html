<body><i>Honey  bees are a beautiful insect. But behind this beauty lies a pain. The pain is that when a honey bee bites someone than the man suffers a pain. The area where the bee bites swells up and the honeybee dies.It dies because when a honeybee dies it tries to take his dung out of the mans skin so it tries so hard that he gets ejected from his dung and some body parts and it causes his death. There is avery aggresive species of honeybees in amazons rainforest if someone breaks thier hive so the honeybees get before him they chase him until  they take their revenge moreover if someone is only heading to their hive they get alert and bite him.
