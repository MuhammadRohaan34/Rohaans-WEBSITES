    <h1>History of Pizza</h1>
    <i>Pizza was origened in Italy.After a war in Italy the people who used to live there became very poor so they wanted a meal that is affordable and which can be a fullmeal for people so they firstly made a dough and on the dough they placed some mashed potatos on the dough and decoreted it with sauce cheese mushrooms olives and tomatos so they baked it in a oven and they started to eat it.Thats the reason rich people dont eat pizza. </i>
